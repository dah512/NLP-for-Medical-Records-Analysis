Why create a lesson as part of your course spec?

It will:

- Allow you to become familiar with the Teach Editor along with our different exercise and slide types earlier.
- Give you a better understanding of course scope (e.g. what can be covered in a reasonable amount of time, and what must be saved for a future course - compared to creating just a course outline.)

In combination, this will result in faster course development time, a more frictionless course development experience, and prevent roadblocks that arise out of miscalibrated course scope.

Our experience working with over a hundred expert instructors over the past 4 years has taught us that the most challenging part of creating a DataCamp course is in understanding the scope of what can be covered in a lesson (and, by extension, a course). 

We believe that students learn best when their hands are on the keyboard, writing code, working with data, and solving problems. Consequently, our courses consist of short  3 to 4 minute videos separated by interactive coding exercises, with occasional multiple choice exercises interspersed. The videos are intended to teach students the concepts necessary to solve the exercises that follow. 

You can read through all of our content guidelines [here](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/guidelines/content.html).

Four minute videos correspond to between **400 and 600 words total** in the script. 

**Teaching data science concepts in this amount of time is not easy:** 
- It forces you to drill down to the essence of the concept and eliminate everything extraneous. 
- It requires a different approach compared to giving 50 minute college lectures.
- Writing such a script as part of your sample lesson will help you in creating a course outline that covers the right amount of content.

All lessons MUST follow our [content guidelines](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/guidelines/content.html).

## Lesson Rubric and Process

### Process

**Timeline**

Please work with your Curriculum Lead to ensure that all of the following boxes are checked. Once that happens, the Content Development team will review the lesson within **3 working days**, and you must incorporate the feedback (if any!) within the next **7 working days.** 

**Feedback Delivery**

There will be no more than **2 rounds of feedback** by a Content Developer, and in each round of feedback, the Content Developer will be specific and unambiguous in explaining exactly what revisions are necessary before the course can be considered ready for handoff. If, after two rounds of feedback, the lesson is still not deemed acceptable by the Content Development team, DataCamp will not move forward with course development.

### Lesson Rubric

#### General

- [ ] Does the lesson consist of 1 video followed by 2-4 exercises?
- [ ] Are there at least 2 coding exercises?
- [ ] Is there no more than 1 multiple choice exercise?
- [ ] Is the script for the video between 400 and 600 words?
- [ ] Are the titles of the exercises and slides written in sentence case?
- [ ] Do all of the exercises run on DataCamp in less than 3 seconds?
- [ ] Does the build pass?

#### Video

- [ ] Are the slides dynamic? That is, is there movement on the slides, such as in the form of transitions between bullets and lines of code, or progression through a visual/schema?
- [ ] Are full sentences in slides avoided?
- [ ] Is there a clear learning objective and/or narrative that motivates why the concept is important?
- [ ] Is there code in the slides? Learning by Doing requires Teaching by Doing!
- [ ] Does the code incorporate a relevant dataset that is [not overused](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/design/brainstorming-datasets.html)?
- [ ] Is the code properly formatted and placed inside backticks? It is your responsibility to ensure that your slides are properly formatted.
- [ ] Is the (trans)script written in complete sentences, without any bullet points or markdown? The script should correspond to exactly what you will say in the final recording and will be used to generate the subtitles for your course.

#### Exercises

- [ ] Are the [Content Guidelines](https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/guidelines/content.html) met?
- [ ] Context: 180-780 characters
- [ ] Instructions: 1-4 bulleted instructions
- [ ] Hints: 1-4 bulleted hints
- [ ] Sample/Solution code: Less than or equal to 15 lines of code
- [ ] Success Message: Is there an informative success message?
- [ ] Do the comments in the sample and solution code match?
- [ ] Are the comments abbreviated instructions?
- [ ] Are the comments free of backticks?
- [ ] Is each comment less than 60 characters of length?
- [ ] Does each comment start with a space?
- [ ] Are different sections of code properly spaced?
- [ ] Are the instructions bulleted?
- [ ] Are the hints bulleted?
- [ ] Is the sample code appropriately scaffolded? Python courses use 4 underscores.

#### FAQs

##### Which lesson should I create for my sample lesson?

This is your choice. We recommend the final lesson of your course, as it has the following advantages:

- The concepts will likely be more advanced, and confirming that you can adequately teach the material in less than 600 words will verify that the course scope is appropriate.
- Similarly, the code will tend to be more advanced and computationally intensive. Confirming that the code runs on DataCamp and that the exercises meet our content guidelines will provide another check to verify that the course scope is indeed appropriate. 
- It provides clarity on where students will be at the end of the course, and a clear stopping point that you can then work towards during the rest of course development.

**Whichever lesson you create, it is important to keep in mind the spirit of the sample lesson:** 
- it is an important check on course scope, 
- an opportunity to acquaint yourself with the tools you will be using to build your course, 
- and a chance to receive early feedback on teaching style to ensure you and DataCamp are aligned on course vision.
